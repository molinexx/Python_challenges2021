    "##### An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike that took exactly  steps, for every step it was noted if it was an uphill, , or a downhill,  step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step up or down represents a  unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:\n",

A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.
